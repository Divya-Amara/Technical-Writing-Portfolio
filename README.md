Welcome to my Technical Writing portfolio Readme.

I am a technical writer with a Masters's degree in Computer Applications.
I enjoy writing, designing, and editing all kinds of technical documents, including,
but not limited to API docs, Online Help, User Guides, White Papers, System Manuals,
RFP's, and Procedure Manuals.
I have 6+ yrs of Technical Writing experience in software applications. I possess a record of success analyzing business needs, then designing and creating user-friendly documents.
Because of my superior communication and interviewing abilities, I was able to work with developers, subject-matter experts, and product owners to immerse myself
in a new software product gather information and identify relevant data.
With training and copy editing experience, I delivered quality document solutions for the Healthcare, Mobile, and IT industries.
Expert skills in planning, organization, time management, and communication have resulted in consistently delivering technical writing projects on time and budget.
Also, I have learned tools like Adobe Frame Maker, RoboHelp, and DITA for
writing print and web-based content.
