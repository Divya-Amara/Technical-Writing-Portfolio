## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide instructions on how to install and use a new LED Sensor light.

# Introduction


OWL LED Sensor light is a motion sensor based LED light for dark places like closets, cabinets, hallways, attics etc., This LED light uses advanced PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor technology, which automatically turns the light on in the dark when motion gets detected within its sensing range.

## Set-up

The following are the items in the box:
1. LED Sensor light
2. USB cable
3. 3M Adhesive

#### Installation

No tools are required for installation. Stick the 3M adhesive and Magnetic Strip together.

 > The total charge time of the battery is 3-4 hours.


## Functions

There are three different sensor modes in which this LED sensor light can be operated.

1. **Always on Mode:**  This mode keeps the light on for a long time. It works as a flashlight.

2. **Motion & Light Sensor Mode:** This mode works in very dark conditions. It automatically turns on when motion is detected within 5 meters. The light automatically turns off in 30 seconds after motion is not detected.

3. **Only Motion Sensor Mode:** This mode works at night time as well in the day time. It automatically turns on when motion is detected within 5 meters. The light automatically turns off in 30 seconds after motion is not detected.


## Switch Mechanism

There are five modes of operating the switch button to get into each mode.

* **Mode 1: Always On**

  Press the Switch button for 5 seconds for **Always On** mode. This mode indicates that the light is always on.


* **Mode 2: Motion & Light Sensor**

  After turning on the light, press the Switch button for a short time, and a green indicator flashes for a second. This means Motion & Light Sensor mode is activated.

* **Mode 3: Only Motion Sensor**

  After turning on the light, press the Switch button twice, and a red indicator flashes for 5 seconds. Then, the Only Motion Sensor is on.

* **Mode 4: Mode 1 & Mode 2**

  After turning on the light, press the Switch button lightly twice for 2 seconds.


* **Mode 5: OFF**

   Keep the Switch pressed for a long time up to 7 seconds to turn off the lights.


## Safety Precautions
